1.1	Document Purpose
This document communicates the business requirements and scope for developing Travel Nest. The scope of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements, business rules and other constraints requirements.

1.2	 Project Background
Currently customers have to go to different websites and search for hotels according to their choices. Or else have to visit physically to check rooms availability. Travelling to hotels also creates some difficulties while travelling. Providing transportation facility is also a key factor. Being in different city it is highly recommended to book rooms before reaching destination. It would also be convenient if transport was made available from railway station, airport or bus station. No facility is present in which hotel provides pick-up and drop services. This will reduce the fraudulence activities done by local transportation services.



1.3	Goals of the project 
•	The main objective of this project is building a website which will help Hotel owners to reach customers. 
•	Booking Hotel rooms and transport cab from railway station, bus station and airport. 
•	On the other side, customers from other cities can also book hotels as well as they can avail car-pooling facilities at the same time and choose hotels and transportation as per their need. 
•	This would make travelling and booking hotels easier.
